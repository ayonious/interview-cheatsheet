# Behavioral Interview Preparation Guide

## Why This Matters

Technical skills get you to the interview, but behavioral skills get you the job. Behavioral interviews assess cultural fit, communication skills, problem-solving approach, and how you handle various workplace situations.

Common behavioral questions include:
- "What's the difference between deadlock and race conditions?"
- "In which case would you prefer using a SQL database instead of noSQL?"
- "Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult team member"
- "Describe a situation where you had to meet a tight deadline"

These are all very common questions during interviews. I know the answers to most of them, but because of memory challenges (which interviewers never believe), I often need more time to articulate responses clearly.

## Please Note

- **This is not a comprehensive guide**: It's my personal cheatsheet for behavioral interview preparation
- **Research is relationship building**: Use insights to build rapport, not to interrogate
