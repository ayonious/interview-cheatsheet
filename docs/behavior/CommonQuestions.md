## Question Preparation Strategy

### 1. **Map Your Experiences**
Create a matrix of your experiences against these question categories:

| Experience | Leadership | Teamwork | Problem-Solving | Accountability | Adaptability |
|------------|------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Project A  | ✓          |          | ✓               |                |              |
| Project B  |            | ✓        |                 | ✓              |              |
| Project C  | ✓          | ✓        | ✓               |                | ✓            |

### 2. **Prepare Variations**
For each core experience, practice different angles:
- **Leadership angle**: How you guided the team
- **Problem-solving angle**: How you overcame challenges
- **Learning angle**: What you learned and applied later

### 3. **Practice Transitions**
Be ready to pivot between related questions:
> "That's a great example of leadership. Can you tell me about a time when you had to work as a team member rather than the leader?"

### 4. **Prepare Follow-up Responses**
Anticipate deeper questions:
- "What would you do differently?"
- "How did others react?"
- "What was the long-term impact?"
- "How has this experience influenced your approach since then?"

Remember: The same experience can often be used to answer multiple types of questions by emphasizing different aspects of your role and impact.
