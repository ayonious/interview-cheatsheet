> My interview Preparation Guide. Having Interview preparation guide is against my will but still better prepare and be confident than not preparing at all

## 🤷 But Why Another Guide?

Picture this: you've just crushed all the technical questions 💪, and then a business manager casually asks:

> "So, what do you do to learn new technologies? Reading books? Following HackerNews...?"

Suddenly, your mind goes blank 🧠💭. You just had lunch, you're in a semi-food-coma state, and now you need to prove how amazing you are. Is it easy? Not at all! 😅

You scramble and mention:
- 💬 Tech meeting discussions
- 🎓 Attending workshops
- 🤖 Using AI
- 📚 "Books? Nah, tech changes too fast..."

**Wait, rewind!** ⏪ Look at that answer again. Where did you mention:
- 🌟 Your open-source contributions?
- 📖 Those Coursera/Udemy courses you completed?
- 📕 Reading "Art of Computer Programming"?

Your hasty response just raised a **BIG RED FLAG** 🚩. One weak answer can overshadow ten great ones. So why not always be ready? 🎯

### 💡 A Word of Wisdom

I once read a beautiful book about finding love, and the author said something profound:

> *"Why leave your love to the hands of luck? Are you sure today's decision is your final decision? Are you sure that person you dated is a big red flag? Are you sure you want to leave this matter on the hands of just a feeling? What about your current live situation? Lots of stress in family/Job, are you sure those are not influencing your mood today in this matter?"*

Job interviews are just like this 💼💕. You'll meet ~5 people, and there's a decent chance at least one won't click with you—and their opinion might carry weight.

Since companies have turned hiring into something **UNPREDICTABLE** 🎲🎪 (why I think  this thats another topic) why risk walking into that room unprepared?
