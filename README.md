> My interview Preparation Guide. Having Interview preparation guide is against my will but still better prepare and be confident than not preparing at all

## 🤷 But Why another Guide?

Imagine after passing all the super hard interview questions some business manager asks you this:

> And what kind of thigns you do in order to learn new technology? For example reading books or subscribe to Hackernews..?

And you just suddenly go searching your entire brain for an answer. You just had lunch and you are almost in some coma and someone is asking you to answer questions to prove how awesome you are. Do you think its easy? Just gonna make 5 points and all done? And only things that come out is discussion in tech meetings. Going to different workshops. And Using AI. And then you say something like reading books is quite dumb because Tech changes so quickly.

Just look at your answer one more time. Based on how you forgot to mention all your achievements in opensource projects, working on multiple coursera/udemy courses, reading books of "Art of programming language" your answer like this could be seen as a big Red flag. And yes these are some problems that can be a big deal. 

If you answer one question in a dumb way that hurts 10 times more than all your good answers. So why not always be ready?
